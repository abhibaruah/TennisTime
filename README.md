# TennisTime

TennisTime is a weather-based application that helps tennis players find the optimal time to play tennis based on current and forecasted weather conditions.

## Features

- Real-time weather data integration
- Personalized recommendations based on your preferences
- Hourly and daily forecasts for tennis playability
- Rain probability alerts
- Temperature comfort ratings for tennis play

## How It Works

TennisTime analyzes multiple weather factors that affect tennis play:
- Temperature (optimal range: 60-85°F / 15-29°C)
- Wind speed (below 15 mph / 24 km/h for optimal play)
- Precipitation probability
- Humidity levels
- Cloud cover

The app then generates a "Tennis Score" for each hour of the day, helping you identify the best times to schedule your matches.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tennistime.git
cd tennistime
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the server, cd to the `server` folder and execute
```bash

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
